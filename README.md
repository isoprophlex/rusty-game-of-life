# Conway's Game of Life in Rust

This is a Rust implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. In this implementation, cells live or die based on a set of rules involving their neighboring cells, creating fascinating patterns and behaviors.
